 Project 1: Interactive Front-End Application

Georgia Tech Bootcamp Project One - Frontend Development. 

Hungries is a restaurant finder in three easy steps using Google maps and Zamato API.


## Technologies

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* jQuery
* Bootstrap

## How the App Works

The user will have the option to find their location or add their current address.
* If the user clicks "Find My Location" it will display their exact location.
* If user decides to write their address it will display that location.


Also have the option to choose the radius of how far they're willing to search for a restaurant.

Once user's location is set, they can now find restaurants by clicking "Find A Place".

Each time they press "Find A Place" a new random restaurant will appear.


If user wants to view all their restaurants they found then they should click "Previous Places". There it will display all
the restaurants they search.
